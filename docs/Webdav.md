**type** | **String** | The type of storage. | 
**endpoint** | **String** | Full URL of the WebDAV server, including scheme (http or https) and path.  | 
**verifyServerCertificate** | **Boolean** | Determines whether Oneprovider should verify the certificate of the WebDAV server.  | [optional] [default to true]
**credentialsType** | **String** | Determines the types of credentials provided in the credentials field.  | [optional] [default to &#39;none&#39;]
**credentials** | **String** | The credentials to authenticate with the WebDAV server. &#x60;basic&#x60; credentials should be provided in the form &#x60;username:password&#x60;, for &#x60;token&#x60; just the token. In case of &#x60;oauth2&#x60;, this field should contain the username for the WebDAV, while the token will be obtained and refreshed automatically in the background. For &#x60;none&#x60; this field is ignored.  | [optional] 
**oauth2IdP** | **String** | In case &#x60;oauth2&#x60; credential type is selected and Onezone is configured with support for multiple external IdP&#39;s, this field must contain the name of the IdP which authenticates requests to the WebDAV endpoint. If Onezone has only one external IdP, it will be selected automatically.  | [optional] 
**onedataAccessToken** | **String** | When registering storage in &#x60;insecure&#x60; mode with &#x60;oauth2&#x60; external IdP, this field must contain a valid Onedata access token of the user on whose behalf the WebDAV storage will be accessed by all users with access to any space supported by this storage.  | [optional] 
**authorizationHeader** | **String** | The authorization header to be used for passing the access token. This field can contain any prefix that should be added to the header value. Default is &#x60;Authorization: Bearer {}&#x60;. The token will placed where &#x60;{}&#x60; is provided.  | [optional] [default to &#39;Authorization: Bearer {}&#39;]
**rangeWriteSupport** | **String** | The type of partial write support enabled in the WebDAV server. Currently 2 types are supported &#x60;sabredav&#x60; which assumes the server supports the SabreDAV PartialUpdate extension via &#x60;PATCH&#x60; method, and &#x60;moddav&#x60; which assumes server supports partial &#x60;PUT&#x60; requests with &#x60;Content-Range&#x60; header. If &#x60;none&#x60; is selected no write support is available for this WebDAV storage.  | [optional] [default to &#39;none&#39;]
**connectionPoolSize** | **Number** | Defines the maximum number of parallel connections for a single WebDAV storage.  | [optional] 
**maximumUploadSize** | **Number** | Defines the maximum upload size for a single &#x60;PUT&#x60; or &#x60;PATCH&#x60; request. If set to 0, assumes that the WebDAV server has no upload limit.  | [optional] 
**fileMode** | **String** | Defines the file permissions, which files imported from WebDAV storage will have in Onedata. Values should be provided in octal format e.g. &#x60;0644&#x60;.  | [optional] [default to &#39;420&#39;]
**dirMode** | **String** | Defines the directory mode which directories imported from WebDAV storage will have in Onedata. Values should be provided in octal format e.g. &#x60;0775&#x60;.  | [optional] [default to &#39;509&#39;]
**insecure** | **Boolean** | Defines whether storage administrator credentials (username and key) may be used by users without storage accounts to access storage in direct IO mode.  | [optional] [default to false]
**storagePathType** | **String** | Determines how the logical file paths will be mapped on the storage. &#39;canonical&#39; paths reflect the logical file names and directory structure, however each rename operation will require renaming the files on the storage. &#39;flat&#39; paths are based on unique file UUID&#39;s and do not require on-storage rename when logical file name is changed.  | [optional] [default to &#39;canonical&#39;]
