/**
 * Onepanel
 * # Overview  This is the RESTful API definition of **Onepanel** component of Onedata data management system [onedata.org](http://onedata.org).  > This API is defined using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), the JSON specification can be used to automatically generate client libraries -   [swagger.json](../../../swagger/onepanel/swagger.json).  This API allows control and configuration of local Onedata deployment, in particular full control over the **Onezone** and **Oneprovider** services and their distribution and monitoring on the local resources.  The API is grouped into 3 categories of operations:   * **Onepanel** - for common operations   * **Oneprovider** - for Oneprovider specific administrative operations   * **Onezone** - for Onezone specific administrative operations  Each of these components is composed of the following services:   * **Worker services** - these are available under `/zone/workers` and     `/provider/workers` paths,   * **Databases services** - each Onedata component stores it's metadata in a     Couchbase backend, which can be distributed on any number of nodes, these     are available under `/zone/databases` and `/provider/databases` paths,   * **Cluster manager services** - this is a service which controls other     deployed processes in one site, these are availables under these are     available under `/zone/managers` and `/provider/managers` paths.  **Onezone** and **Oneprovider** components are composed of 3 types of services: **managers**, **databases** and **workers**.  Using this API each of these components can be deployed, configured, started and stopped on a specified host in the local site, in the context of either **Onezone** or **Oneprovider** service.  All paths listed in this documentation are relative to the base Onepanel REST API which is `/api/v3/onepanel`, so complete URL for a request to Onepanel service is:  ``` http://HOSTNAME:PORT/api/v3/onepanel/... ```  ## Authentication  ### Token authentication  The recommended, safest way of authenticating requests to Onepanel API is using the **Onedata access tokens**. The token should be present in `X-Auth-Token` or `Authorization: Bearer` header. See [Onezone documentation](/#/home/api/latest/onezone?anchor=section/Overview/Authentication-and-authorization) for detailed explanation of the token concepts.  Curl examples: ```bash curl -H \"X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN\" [...] curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" [...] curl -H \"Macaroon: $TOKEN\" [...]   # DEPRECATED ```   ### Passphrase authentication  The token authentication dependes on the Onezone service. In special cases - during Onezone deployment or its outage - it is necessary to use the local **emergency passphrase**.  The passphrase should be provided in a Basic authentication header with username `onepanel`. For curl users this means ```bash curl -u onepanel:TheEmergencyPassphrase ```  The passphrase can also be sent without any username, as the whole content of base64-encoded string in Basic authorization header, e.g. ```bash curl -H \"Authorization: Basic $(echo -n TheEmergencyPassphrase | base64)\" ```  The passphrase is set during deployment. It can be changed in the Onepanel GUI or with an API request: ```bash curl -X PUT 'https://$HOST:9443/api/v3/onepanel/emergency_passphrase' \\ -u onepanel:TheEmergencyPassphrase -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{\"currentPassphrase\": \"TheEmergencyPassphrase\", \"newPassphrase\": \"TheNewPassphrase\"}' ```  ## API structure  The Onepanel API is structured to reflect that it can either be used to control **Onezone** or **Oneprovider** deployment, each Onedata component deployment has a separate Onepanel instance. In order to make the API calls explicit, **Onezone** or **Oneprovider** specific requests have different paths, i.e.:   * Onezone specific operations start with `/api/v3/onepanel/zone/`   * Oneprovider specific operations start with `/api/v3/onepanel/provider/`   * Common operations paths include `/api/v3/onepanel/users`,     `/api/v3/onepanel/hosts` and `/api/v3/onepanel/tasks`  The overall configuration of each component can be controlled by updating `/api/v3/onepanel/zone/configuration` and `/api/v3/onepanel/provider/configuration` resources.  ## Examples  Below are some example requests to Onepanel using cURL:  **Add storage resource to provider** ```bash curl -X POST -u onepanel:Passphrase1 -k -vvv -H \"content-type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"NFS\": {\"type\": \"posix\", \"mountPoint\": \"/mnt/vfs\"}}' \\ https://172.17.0.4:9443/api/v3/onepanel/provider/storages ```  **Add a new Onezone worker** ```bash curl -X POST -u onepanel:Passphrase1 -k -vvv -H \"content-type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"hosts\": [\"node1.p1.1.dev\"]}' \\ https://172.17.0.4:9443/api/v3/onepanel/zone/workers ```
