## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**storagePathType** | **String** | Determines how the logical file paths will be mapped on the storage. &#39;canonical&#39; paths reflect the logical file names and directory structure, however each rename operation will require renaming the files on the storage. &#39;flat&#39; paths are based on unique file UUID&#39;s and do not require on-storage rename when logical file name is changed.  | [optional] [default to &#39;canonical&#39;]
